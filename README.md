# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and SARIMA Models

This project explores time series forecasting using classical statistical models.  

I applied **ARIMA** and **SARIMA** to two different datasets:
- **S&P 500 daily returns** → financial market data
- **Johnson & Johnson quarterly EPS** → corporate earnings data

The report shows how to identify time series characteristics, fit models, evaluate diagnostics, and generate forecasts.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Quarto** → for literate programming and publishing  
- **R** → statistical computing and visualization  
- **ggplot2** for time series plots  
- **ARIMA & SARIMA** models for short-term and seasonal forecasting  

## Project Highlights
- **Exploratory analysis**: trend, volatility, and seasonality checks  
- **Model building**: step-by-step ARIMA and SARIMA fitting  
- **Diagnostics**: residual analysis, ACF/PACF interpretation, Ljung–Box tests  
- **Forecasting**: out-of-sample predictions with confidence intervals  

## Repository Structure
- `Time-Series-Project.qmd` → Quarto source file  
- `index.html` → rendered report (deployed via GitHub Pages)  
- `*_files/` → images and dependencies generated during rendering  
- `README.md` → project overview
